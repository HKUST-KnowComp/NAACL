In Rowling's universe, the mystery is always solved by a living hero who restores order, whereas Christie's novel dismantles the very concept of a heroic resolution.

He points out that her stories, without exception, feature a recurring detective who exists outside the immediate circle of victims, a structural choice that provides a clear investigative lens. This methodology is fundamentally at odds with the claustrophobic paranoia of *And Then There Were None*, where every character is a potential victim. Rowling’s focus on the procedural aspect of crime-solving, Finch concludes, demonstrates a deliberate choice to build upon the Sherlock Holmes tradition rather than the nihilistic experiment of Christie's isolated mystery. Her entire bibliography shows a consistent preference for external investigation over the internal implosion of a trapped cast. Therefore, according to this critical analysis, she has never penned a novel that adheres to that specific formula.",

At its core is the principle of imitative polyphony, where a melodic idea introduced by one voice is subsequently restated by other voices. The fugue, perhaps the most celebrated contrapuntal form, is built upon a short melodic theme called the subject, which is systematically developed. Composers like Johann Sebastian Bach meticulously controlled the interplay of consonance and dissonance, ensuring each voice maintained its melodic integrity. Strict rules governed the movement between voices, including the avoidance of parallel perfect intervals like octaves and fifths.
